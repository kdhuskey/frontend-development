        <p>Hawaii is by far my wife and I favorite place to visit out of all other places we have been to.</p>
        <p>We made our maiden voyage in February of 2019 for our anniversary. On that trip we visited <bold><em>TWO</em></bold> different islands.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.gohawaii.com/islands/oahu"><strong>Oahu</strong></a></li>
                <div><ul><li>-Oahu is where the capital is located, Honolulu. Bustling city, if it weren't for the beaches and gorgeous views, you would almost forget you were in paradise</li></ul></div>
            <li><a href="https://www.gohawaii.com/islands/kauai"><strong>Kauai</strong></a></li>
                <div><ul><li>-Kauai is nicknamed the 'garden isle' because of the lush forestry you will see everywhere. Part of the original jurassic park was filmed here.</li></ul></div>
